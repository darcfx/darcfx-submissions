Subclass - Visual Basic Subclass Control
Copyright (c) 1997 SoftCircuits Programming (R)
Redistributed by Permission

This code demonstrates how to write a subclassing control in Visual Basic
(version 5 or later). The code takes advantage of the new AddressOf
keyword, which can only be used from a BAS module. A common BAS module
keeps track of all the current control instances within the current
process and then intercepts Windows messages, calling specific control
instances as appropriate.

WARNING: This software is copyrighted. You may only use this software in
compliance with the following conditions. By using this software, you
indicate your acceptance of these conditions.

 1.    You may freely use and distribute the supplied Subclass.ocx with your
       own programs as long as you assume responsibility for such programs
       and hold the original author(s) harmless from any resulting
       liabilities.

 2.    You may use this source code within your own programs (embedded within
       the resulting EXE or DLL file) as long as you assume responsibility
       for such programs and hold the original author(s) harmless from any
       resulting liabilities.

 3.    You may NOT distribute this source code, regardless of the extent of
       modifications, except as part of the original, unmodified
       Subclass.zip.

 4.    You may NOT recompile this source code and distribute the resulting
       Subclass.ocx, regardless of the extent of modifications.

The reason for these conditions is to prevent the distribution of different
versions of Subclass.ocx. Multiple versions would prevent enforcement of
backwards compatibility and increase problems encountered by programs that
are distributed with Subclass.ocx. Please respect these conditions. If you
find a problem or would like an enhancement, please contact SoftCircuits.
