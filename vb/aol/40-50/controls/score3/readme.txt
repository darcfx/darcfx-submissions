ok, this is Scrambler Score Keeper v1.0 by me, suprgeek

it's really easy to use, i made it for vb5, but it might work with other
versions. to load it, goto (on the menu) Project then go to Components
and one you see the components screen click browse. after finding score.ocx
click ok.  ok, now you should see a stoopid looking icon on your toolbox. 
that's the control.

to use control just call one event: addname
the addname has 2 arguments thename and score
those are kind of self explainitory

not only does addname add the name and score, if the name is already there
it updates the score

example:
XFakeDoodX just got the answer correct
score1.addname("XFakeDoodX",1)


that's it.

it will automaticly look to see if it's there and if it isn't it will add
it with the score, if it is it will update the score.  if you use this let me
know, cuz if enough people use it, i'll add a popup menu that comes up when 
you right click on a name and lets you delete it or whatever.
