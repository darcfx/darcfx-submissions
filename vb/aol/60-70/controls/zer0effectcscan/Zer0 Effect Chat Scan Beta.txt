Thank you for Downloading my Chatscan-

[Features]-
The Chatscan is in beta, so it only has the SN and MSG from last chat
line, i will be adding subs to the chatscan for aol 7.0 like send chat, 
instant message, enterpr, and others if you would like a specific code
added e-mail me and i may add it...

[Known Issues]-
-It may skip a line every once in a while, doesn't happen often though
-If the chatscan is minimized it will not scan the room
-same if vice versa
-that msg may pick up Link 1 of 1 at the end of the line-kinda rare
-Link 1 of 1 changes to Link 1 of 2 and up if you are going to download
and test this maybe someone may beable to shed some light on me. i have
checked my codeing and cannont figure out why it picks up this string
furthermore why this strings changes, if you can help me out with this 
please do...
