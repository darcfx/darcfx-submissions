thank you for choosing my .ocx.
i believe i have included enough methods to make a pretty good aim add-on program. 

note:

	the auto repond method should be used in a timer. it will find all open IM windows and insert your response. 

		please email me at sab345@psu.edu if you have any questions/comments. i would be glad to add any methods you can think of , as well.
