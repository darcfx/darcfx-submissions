xWhat is wgf,WgF,\/\/gF, and \/\/g|=  ?
xThis is a question I get often. wgf is me and my friend.
xBut before i give you the history I'll give you what it stands for
xWarren & Girard's Freaky VB. I am Girard. 
xNow I know that is pretty lame symbolism but look at KnK's
xKrAzY -n- KiW Vb stuff, heh thats pretty lame too. 
xThe reason for all the diffrent handles is of the fact that
xwe had a lot. I now use "wgf" The one I used mmostly before was "WgF"
x
xNow to the history.
xThe history of WgF is sort of like KnK's, Two friends got together to 
xfool around with aol. Warren was my friend, its not his real name but
xit was our nick name for him. We lived together in Flordia and had fun
xprograming. We played around for a year with it then I moved. Since
xthen we keep intouch via phone. He never really did anything in the
xbut he was a motivation in our little click. No one really ever heard
xof us but that is okay cause you know now,hehe. So when ever you saw 
xa signature of Warren G or Waren G or Waren G Funk is was just in
xrespect of the two forrmer aol-buds. I now run my own VB Site 
xwhich I consider to be a very good.  I will be around for awhile
xand with me being only 14 you will be seeing the next genoration
xof aol programing site in me most likely.
xLater,
