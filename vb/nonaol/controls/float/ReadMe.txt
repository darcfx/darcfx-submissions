Read Me File for the FloatButton OCX control.

The FloatButton OCX control is Freeware.  You may distribute 
freely with you applications.  You are free to distribute
copies of the control by itself as long as you also distribute 
the files (unmodified that came with this control.  
These files are listed below.

The FloatButton OCX control was developed with the Visual Basic
5.0 Control Creation Edition.  This means that you will need the
VB 5 runtime files. I recommend using this control with VB 5 
especially if you plan on distributing your control.

If you are using this with VB 4 32 then you must remember that
you will need to ship the VB 5 DLL's along with your VB 4 DLL's.
This could make for one large setup.  That is why I recommend
that you use it with VB 5.

To register this control just open up VB and go to the screen
where you pick your components (In VB5 it is under the 
Projects|Components Menu). Click on the browse button. Now
find the FloatButton.OCX and click OK.  Thats it.  Just remember
to check the X box next to the component name to add it to your
project.

These are the files that you should have received with this
control.
