# DarcFX.com and GitHub darcfx-submissions project

## History of Darc's Programming Website: DarcFX.com
DarcFX.com was created in August of 2000. I embarked upon setting up a personal website to post my programs, helpful code snipets, and tutorials on how to make programs, which at the time were mostly AOL mods. Things went slow. To say the least, DarcFX.com was competing with one of the largest tutorial and example sites on the web at that time, KnK 4 Life.

At this stage in my life, I was a regular user of TheZone IRC Network	(irc.tzirc.com -> #TheZone Web @ http://tzirc.com/). I hadn't really been close with Bill (KnK), but I did know him from #TheZone as he popped in from time to time. Bill eventually got busy with life, and decided to close KnK 4 Life, for life. But instead of rendering his site useless, he decided to sell CDs with all the files on it, hoping that someone would take-over. I bought KnK CD no. 2. Bill had allowed me to post all the KnK files with or without credit to himself. Of course, because I am not lame, he's been right here up-front in the story ever since.

Those files were added to the ones I was already hosting on DarcFX.com the day after I received the CD of the submission files in the mail. Bill linked this site on his home page, and the files were reserved just as normal minus the banner ads (God knows how much I hate them) and with direct file links instead of routing you to another "link page." I continued to receive file submissions, and to post files received as quickly as I received them, which dropped off in the following years with the advent of broadband and the reduction of AOL's userbase (myself included).

Someone began a Facebook Group — "AOL Proggies" (Web @ https://www.facebook.com/groups/297526060414740/)	— I assume for nostalgia. They were posting links to apps and screenshots to things they had made back in the day... and it got me thinking. So in 2016, I migrated the legacy files, all the DarcFX File Submissions, to GitHub, where the entire project can be downloaded at will by all. Git is the new face of open source. It's about time DarcFX joins the 21st century. I'll probably still keep the site open, though, and just link to the GitHub repository.

And who knows... I might do something else with the site one day. I've always liked the theme. We shall see!

## Website Development Languages
Originally, DarcFX.com was developed in PHP. As a side-project, on a boring Saturday, I upgraded the core components of this site in 2010 to ASP.NET 4.0 using Visual C#, my now favorite (and considered native) language. Now? It's just HTML/CSS.

## Contact and IRC
I still have an IRC Server linked to TheZone IRC Network (Web @ http://tzirc.com/), which Syber and I co-administrate. There is a relay out there for those of you who still wish to use irc.darcfx.com. I pretty much squat in #TheZone now. There's also a great web chat feature on TheZone's site. I've also become a regular of #fsociety on irc.freenode.net (Web @ http://fsociety.guru/).
