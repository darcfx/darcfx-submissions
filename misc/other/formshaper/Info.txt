   Shapeaform 1.0 by PAT or JK for 32 bit versions of VB
===========================================================

ok I saw you already had a form shaper program in you d/l
section but this program is a little different.  It lets
you draw the shape of the form you want (oval or custom) on
a picture of the form, and then will generate the api code 
(which goes in the form_load event) to make a form that shape.

You can also create holes in the form so you can see through
to the other side.  The api functions that need to be declared 
for the generated code to work are in the help section.
