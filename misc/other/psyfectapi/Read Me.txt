     - An api spy without all the bullshit -

                 Version 1.0 Build 2

  This program introduces the first ever
Find Window Function EX. This utility
allows the user to define the specific
controls to search a parent window for
verification.

      For Example:

  You could have the find window function
only search for a listbox, and font combo
box. Then define the parent as the window
you need, simply by dragging the icon to
the parent window, then the two controls.

  Thus cutting back on needless code.
(See my small code tutorial that came in
the zip file.)

                 - Possible Updates -

  The enhanced version might check to
make sure you get the last object of the
class you selected with the ex function,
It's pretty easy to do on your own, so I'm
not sure I'll bother implementing an option
that does so.

                      - Utilization -

  Once you have drug the 'capture box' 
onto the desired window, you can then
create a function to find a window that
has children, or generate code for that
function by right clicking the icon at the
top left of the main screen.

  You can also create a ready bas file,
which generates 'needed api,' 'manip 
codes,' and the 'ManipChild' function
which is now required in your module to
'gen code for function.'

  This is because the ManipChild function
cuts down on code (read the tutorial in the
zip).

  Or you can skip all of that and head
straight for the extended tool.

  When you select 'invert,' on the (ex)
function, the caption up top will only notify
you of possible conflicting children.

  You can however add a class that does
not show up.  For instance, if you defined
your 'Sign On' screen with all 4 icons, you
can select another icon on the tool bar to
make sure there is not a 5th icon on the
window it searches.

  The find window function (non ex) still
generates the least amount of WORKING
lines than any other api spy I have seen.
But the (ex) is even incredibly smaller.

                          - About -

  This program was created because of the
poor find window function generators out
there.  Mines far from perfect itself, there
is one type of window you can't find
because I was to bored to fix all the errors
this type of window causes.

  You can not find a window that has a
child with the same class name.  YOU
CAN, however, use the extended function
to find the parent then a child of a different
class.

  It just doesn't occur enough for me to
care to fix it.  The other code gens do not
generate correct code for this either, so
you have nothing to worry about.

  At least this way it will let you know it
wont work, keeping you from thinking it
does, then tossing it in your code and
blah blah blah, it's just a waste of time.

                      - Thanks -
  Special thanks goes to my girlfriend
                      (psyclops)
  for her patience and understanding.

  Thanks to Wayne, Tripp, Tony, and 
Ken of Static-X for their incredible hard
work and awesome talent.  Without them
and my g/f I'd go insane.

                     - Known Issues -

  Nothing major here, just a few kinks I
might smooth out.
1.  The child class problem mentioned
     above.
2.  Edit box in a chat room, The reason
     this happens is due to aol's set up,
     don't worry though, it doesn't happen
     on any other apps and does not affect
     your generated code.
3.  That's it, heh.

                      - Good Tips -

  Check out my manip function, it can be
used in conjunction with the api spy by
checking the objects number in it's
'classes line.'

  Read the "Small Code.doc" file that
came with this program.  In it, you will find
the manip function, along with some
interesting tips on keeping your code small
and why that one function can save you
tons of code.

  If you find a bug you think I'm not aware
of let me know, this program was only
made off and on for a week.

  I welcome any and all questions related
to vb and/or this spy.  Just make sure you
tried the corresponding help files first.
