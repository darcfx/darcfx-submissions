Greetin's all,

	1. What it is:    ListBox Search
	2. Made By:       NightShade    
	3. What bas used: Just declarations
	4. VB Version:    Visual Basic 6.0

	This example shows an API search for a string in an listbox. 
The API search is faster then a regular VB search. This search example
is NOT case senstive.
