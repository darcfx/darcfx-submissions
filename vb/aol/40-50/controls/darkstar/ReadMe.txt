INTRODUCTION:
	Sup. This OCX has a ton of features that a 
programmer usually uses most of the time.  This makes
proggin alot easier.  This will subclass the AOL Chatroom
AND some other things as well.

	- Get the LastChatLine, The ScreenName, and the whole message w/ screenname.
        - Get your Screen Name from the Welcome Window.
        - Send Mail or an IM.
        - Send Chat, Wavy Chat, or a link that isn't underlined.
        - Change AOL's caption and the chatroom your in.
        - Get the name of the CharRoom you are in.

        - AddRoom to listbox, combobox, and textbox.
        - Put people in a listbox into a mailable form. (name1, name2, etc.)
        - And much more...

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE:
DarkStar1.ChangeAOLCaption ("America  Online  Sucks") '<--Will change AOL's title.
DarkStar1.ChangeChatRoomCaption ("DarkStar Toolz: Room [vb]") '<--will change the chatroom title to what you wrote in ()'s
DarkStar1.Keyword ("Beta") '<---Goes to Keyword Beta

FINAL THOUGHTS:
	You SHOULD know how to use the rest of the options. If not...you gatta learn.
I'm not putting in a Bot code cuz all the person will do iz copy the code and
call it their own.  If you have one ounze of programming abilities you should
be able to use this prog with ease.
