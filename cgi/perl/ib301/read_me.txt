Ikonboard Perl Tester
---------------------

This script will be able to tell you if you have perl running, and the sufficient modules to run it.
It will also try to determine the path name, and the sendmail path for you.


Instructions
------------

Simply upload the script into the directory you wish to install Ikonboard into.
Check with your webhost for the correct CHMOD value for executing perl scripts (usually 755).
Chmod the script to that value, and call it through your web browser (http://www.yourdomain.com/perl_test.cgi)

If the script outputs as text, you do not have perl installed in that directory.

That's it!
