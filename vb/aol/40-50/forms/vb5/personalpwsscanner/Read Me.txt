OK here is an example of a personal scanner.It is not like a normal pwsd or a deltree detector, this Example allows you to type in your own string to Scan for for. For Example:
if you wanted to scan a program for a cuss word or an email address...all you would do is type in
the text box the string...Push Scan....and it will tell you if your string is in the program that you scanned.
it is very simple bu susprisingly I have seen no one do it before.

well i am happy to submit this form to knk...

Any Questions please e-mail me at Mysteryman32@juno.com
