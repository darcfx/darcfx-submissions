ÿMWelcome to the World of Pokémon, -PLAYER-!
 
My name is Professor Oak, or Prof. Oak for short. I am 
a pokémon expert and the inventor of the pokédex. I 
have been watching your entire pokémon career and 
the way you beat the elite four, however there is still 
work you must do. A new pokémon league is forming 
and the old one is disbanding. My reputation just 
doesn't cut it anymore, but if you are able to regain 
pokémon master status both our careers will be 
saved. Here is your pokédex and your old pal 
Pikachu. Since you have access to all cities, this 
won't be as difficult as it is for aspiring pokémon 
masters. Be sure to collect all 150 pokémon before 
you go up against the new pokémon league and be 
sure to steer clear of Team Rocket. They are more 
powerful than ever!
 
Goodbye and Goodluck!
-Prof. Oak
