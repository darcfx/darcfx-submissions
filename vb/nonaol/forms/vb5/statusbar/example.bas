Attribute VB_Name = "Module1"
'(keep in mind that the status bar is label1)
'Now Say i want the status bar to read wow when your mouse is over the button
'In the buttons code under MouseMove Put This
'label1.caption = "wow"
'This Would Make The Caption of label1 to wow.

'Keep in mind that you dont always have to use a label as the status bar
'you could use a button or what ever you want just change the Label1.caption
'to [name of object].caption = "[your message here]"
'Simple as that

'Hey if ya dont get it know you will get it later
'Trust Me!
