This is mainly for beginners!
To most people it's like raising
your right hand, but for some it's
like trying to count all the stars
in the sky! :o) So, for those who
know what there doing and they think
they know everything about VB just
delete this file now and don't get
lame over it! For those beginners
I hope you learn something! Peace.
