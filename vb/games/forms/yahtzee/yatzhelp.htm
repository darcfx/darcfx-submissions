<h3><font color="#008000">Game Summery</font></h3>

<p>On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination for one of 13 categories.
  After you finish rolling, you must click the area you would like to place the score on the category.  
If you make a mistake in selecting the category you would like to place your score, you can hit ctrl-z or use the game 
menu to undo your last selection.  The game ends when you have filled all 13 categories.
  Scores are totalled, including any bonus points.</p>

<h3><font color="#008000">How To Play</font></h3>

<p>On each turn you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and score after your first or second roll.
  To roll the dice, just click the roll button.  On your first roll you will roll all five dice.  Click on any dice  
you would like to keep.  You may stop now if you'd like to score.  On your second roll you may re-roll any or all the
 dice you want even if you have previously kept them.  You may change your mind at anytime you want up to the end of 
 the turn on which dice to keep.  You may stop and score after your second time or click any dice you would like to 
 keep and roll again.  On your third and final roll, like the others you may select to keep any dice you want from your 
 previous rolls or roll them all again.  After this roll you MUST select a category to score in.  After you select the 
 category your turn is over. There is a total of 13 turns per game.</p>

<h3><font color="#008000">After You Roll</font></h3>

<p>When you are finished rolling, decide which category you would like to place your score.  For each game, 
there are 13 categories and a bonus Yahtzee area. You must select one of these on each turn.  If you have no 
valid play you must take a zero in one of the categories.  You can choose to take a zero on a category even 
if you can score in another.  You can only choose a category once during a game, except the bonus Yahtzee, 
it may be selected as many times as you get a Yahtzee in a game, although it will only become active after your
first Yahtzee.  Fill in each category only once in any order, depending on your best scoring option.</p>

<p>The scoring areas are divided into a Left
and Right section.  Scoring combinations
are as follows:</p>

<div align=center>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
 <tr>
  <td width=101 valign=top>
  <p>Left Section</p>
  </td>
  <td width=375 valign=top>
  <p>Aces (Ones) – Total of all ones.</p>
  <p>Twos – Total of all twos.</p>
  <p>Threes – Total of all threes.</p>
  <p>Fours – Total of all fours.</p>
  <p>Fives – Total of all fives.</p>
  <p>Sixes – Total of all sixes.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width=101 valign=top>
  <p>Right Section</p>
  </td>
  <td width=375 valign=top>
  <p>3 of a Kind - Total of all 5 dice (At
  least 3 matching dice)</p>
  <p>4 of a Kind - Total of all 5 dice (At
  least 4 matching dice)</p>
  <p>Full House - 25 Points (3 matching dice
  and 2 matching dice)</p>
  <p>Small Straight - 30 Points (1-2-3-4,
  2-3-4-5, 3-4-5-6)</p>
  <p>Large Straight - 40 Points (1-2-3-4-5,
  2-3-4-5-6)</p>
  <p>Yahtzee (5 of a Kind) - 50 Points (All 5
  matching dice)</p>
  <p>Chance - Total of all 5 dice (All rolls
  can be a chance)</p>
  <p>Bonus YAHTZEE (2 or
  more Yahtzee's in one game) - 100 Points</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>Your goal in the left section is to score a
total of at least 63 points, to earn a 35 point bonus.  The bonus points are based on scoring three
of each number (Aces through Sixes) however, you may earn the bonus points with
any combination of scores totalling 63 points or more.</p>

<p>NOTICE:  If you have a Yahtzee
already and get another Yahtzee, you will automatically have 100 points added
to your score and can select any area to put your score in that is left
open.  For example, if you get a Bonus
Yahtzee you can use it to score a Large Straight.</p>

<h3><font color="#008000">Ending A Game</font></h3>

<p>The game ends when you have completely
filled in all 13 categories.  The
computer will automatically have totalled your score.</p>

<img width=50 height=47 src="die.gif"> Useful Hints</h1>

<ul>
 <li>It is very important to get the maximum value you can in the
     left part of the score table, in particular to get at least 63 points, so
     you can have the 35 points bonus.</li>
 <li>To sum 63 points you have to get 3 times every number from 1 to
     6. If you have to fill a box with a lower number of dice, you should try
     to get more points in the other boxes. The aces box can be useful if you
     have to mark a lower score, or a 0.</li>
 <li>Try to keep the chance box empty as long as possible, it will
     be very useful in the last moments of the game.</li>
 <li>If the game is about to end, and if you have to score a 0, try
     to mark it in the Yahtzee or in the maximum scale boxes, because these are
     the most difficult to mark with points.</li>
 <li>

<p>Try to mark 3 of a kind and 4 of a kind
with high values, because you score the sum of all the 5 dice.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
