Short Description : 

VoiceAction is Speech Recognition ActiveX Custom Control
which provides a ready made kit for programmers who want
to develop or add to their current developments 
speech recognition capabilities. It features Wave To Text,
Vocabulary and Language Artificial Intelligence design too.

Long Description:

VoiceAction is a  innovation. 
We have truly opened up speech recognition for the first time on earth.(?) 
Read further.
VoiceAction does not use or currently support  microsoft-sapi's or
 any other company's architecture, instead it makes user build 
his own basic vocabulary database through easy to use interface
and this feature enables him to design his own  Artificial Intelligence 
language database  of words (also through a friendly interface).

All this gives the programmer a  absolutely complete reach
over all the speech required operations. 

The programmer can hence monitor his program design to
 disable substitutions and increase accuracy.

We have a ready made 'Windows Multimedia Speech User
 Interface Setup' too. VoiceAction does everything from
 recording, to the construction of final word. With VoiceAction
 one can prepare a speech program in minutes. 
 See the examples prepared in Visual Basic 5.0.
