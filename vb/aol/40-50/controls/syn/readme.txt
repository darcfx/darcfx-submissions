people that downloaded my chat scan,

this may not be the best chat scan.
i've worked out as many bugs as possible
but this is only my first version of the chat scan.
so if you find any bugs e-mail to the address below.
the reason i prefer this chat scan over dos's,rip's, or
chip's is the size comparison. my ocx is compiled to be
23kb while theirs are 440+kb. although i have not tested mine
as much as theirs. 

i'm planning on sending the source to magent's site.
which is:
http://magentvb.cjb.net
(this source will not cost you any money, it will be free)

the source will be written in vb5ee.
i will make it fully instructional, explaining everything.

peace

make a prog with you, or anything else that is far-fetched.
