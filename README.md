# darcfx-submissions

// History of DarcFX
DarcFX.com was created in August of 2000.  I embarked upon setting up a personal website to post my programs, helpful code snipets, and tutorials on how to make programs such as the ones I made, which at the time were mostly AOL mods.  Things went slow.  To say the least, DarcFX.com was competing with one of the largest tutorial and example sites on the web, instantly recognized by most as KnK 4 Life. 

At this stage in my life, I was a regular user of TheZone IRC Network (irc.tzirc.com - #TheZone).  I hadn't really been close with Bill (KnK), but I did know him since he did pop into #TheZone from time to time.  Bill eventually got busy with life, and decided to close KnK 4 Life, for life.  But instead of rendering his site useless, he decided to sell CDs with all the files on it, hoping that someone would take-over.  I bought KnK CD no. 2.  Bill had allowed me to post all the KnK files with or without credit to himself.  Of course, because I am not lame, he's been right here up-front in the story ever since.

DarcFX.com went live the day after I received the CD of the submission files in the mail.  Bill linked me on his home page, and the files were reserved just as normal minus the banner ads (God knows how much I hate them) and with direct file links instead of routing you to another "link page."

Originally, DarcFX.com was developed in PHP.  As a side-project, on a boring Saturday, I upgraded the core components of this site in 2010 to ASP.NET 4.0 using Visual C#, my now favorite (and considered native) language.  

Anyways, I still have an IRC Server at rock.tzirc.com with TheZone IRC Network, which Syber and I co-administrate.  There is a relay out there for those of you who still wish to use irc.darcfx.com.  I pretty much squat in #TheZone now.  There's also a great web chat feature on TheZone's site.  I've also become a regular of #fsociety on irc.freenode.net.
