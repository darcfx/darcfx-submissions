Ocx Name: ChatSet Ocx
Author: Gerald Cole aka myst
Made in: Visual Basic 5.0 Professional Edition

Example of how to use:
Private Sub Form_Load()
ChatSet1.ChangeCaption "ChatSet by: myst" 'this line is optional
ChatSet1.AddtoChat
End Sub

Private Sub Form_Resize()
ChatSet1.ResizeChat
End Sub

Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
ChatSet1.RemovefromChat
End Sub

* Note - If you take the line where it says ChatSet1.ChangeCaption "ChatSet by: myst" out and don't put a different changecaption in, then it will just set the caption to the room's caption.

Additional Info:
This will take what you put inside the ocx and add it to the chatroom.  At first I made this for my friend and myself for a program we are going to put out.  I thought about and decided to make it into an ocx.  Hope you enjoy it.
