VbInet.exe is a sample file that demonstrates how to declare many of the WinInet functions 
in Visual Basic.  You should be able to use the included declaration file for most 
of your Visual Basic applications that use the WinInet functions.

The included file, WinInet.bas contains declarations for a number of WinInet functions 
and constants that Visual Basic programmers can use from their applications.  This is 
not an exhaustive list of declarations for WinInet functions but it does cover the most 
commonly used functions and almost all of the constant definitions. 

Some common Win32 function declarations are also included in this file.

The WinInet.bas file needs to be included in another Visual Basic project. 
It can not be used as a Visual Basic project on its own.
