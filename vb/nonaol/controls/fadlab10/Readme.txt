CNS FadeLabel ActiveX - Version 1.00.0002


First of all: This ActiveX-Control is freeware! You are allowed to develop and distribute applications which make use of it. BUT you may not redistribute the control alone; every developer has to download a registered ActiveX from my webpage! If you want to distribute it with your program, the only you should do is to insert the following text into any Info-Dialog:
