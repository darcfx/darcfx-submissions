Okay.  Here's the deal.  Please do not
insert this file into the cgi-bin directory.

All you have to do is insert the "tcounter"
folder into your cgi-bin, open the "count.txt"
file and type in the number you want your
counter to start at.  Then, on your website,
call it (WITHOUT SSI) by saying:

<script src="cgi-bin/tcounter/tcounter.cgi" language=javascript> </script>

Wala!  You have yourself a brand new AD FREE
text counter without the use of the Sever
Side Includes.  This is also the same
file used on Darc FX.com!
