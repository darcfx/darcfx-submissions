<HTML><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Hi, this is rapta. Thanx for downloading my FLUL.ocx. Here i will explain how to use my <BR>
flul ocx! 1st of all open up vb. Press Control + T and look for something that says<BR>
FirstLetterUnderlined in hte list. btw download this ocx or place it in ur windows/system<BR>
If u dont seen anything like FIrstLetterUnderlined in the list click browse and manually<BR>
attach it to the list. Then X it in. And should see a new icon on ur tool bar! click on it<BR>
and make a FLUL on ur form. (as u would like a button) then thats all u have to do with<BR>
the ocx. Then lets start out an example how to send something to the chat room FLULed. Make a button on ur form. And place this code inside it:<BR>
(btw u will need a bas that has a sub to send to the chat room i am useing chatsend change that to ur bas's sub)<BR>
Chatsend FLUL1.FLUL("Hi this text has been FLULed with rapta's Flul.ocx!","#00AA00","impact")<BR>
thats it as u can see change what i have wrote "Hi this text has been FLULed with rapta's Flul.ocx!" to waht ever u want and change #00AA00 to the color of the text u want it to be! and change impact to the fontface to the fontface u wanted! Also a question i have been asked alot if how do i send a link to the chat room. Well here i how<BR>
Chatsend "< a href=URL> & FLUL1.FLUL("Click here to see my site","#00AA00","impact") & "</a>"<BR>
