Visual Basic 5
Runtime Modules

The Visual Basic Runtime Modules are required for many different
Visual Basic applications for Windows. They need only be installed
to your system once and then will be available for any number of
Visual Basic Applications.

The Visual Basic version number that is used to create the 
application is important in that you'll need to assure the
proper Runtime Modules are installed for that particular version
of Visual Basic. See the documentations for the application in
question to determine which version of the Visual Basic Runtime
Modules is required.

Simtel makes all Visual Basic Runtime Module versions available
at their site. Please use the following URL's anytime!
