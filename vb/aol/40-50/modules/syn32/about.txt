file: Syn32.bas (vb4+ module)
completion: 0.27
reliability: ??

okay i figured that i should make a module, but then i got to thinking... "what am i 
going to put in this module?". and to answer that question, i'm going to ask that all
of you who download this module send me your ideas, no matter how stupid they are, i 
will post anything you request as long as it can be done with vb and i know how to. ;c)
so this module will not be for me, it will be for all of you who want a module with subs
and functions that you find useful. and with that said i have not gone thru and thoroughly
checked this module, kuz i'm only a little over a quarter of a way done with it, but that
could all change, depending on how many people send requests...

the fuck up. ;c)
