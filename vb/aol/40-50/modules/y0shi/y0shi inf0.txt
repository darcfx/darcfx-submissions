yiz0 guys,

	this is my bas that i've been workin' on for quite a while. it has aol codes, aim codes, api
codes, internet gaming zone codes, regular string codes, and a whole bunch of weird computer stuff. the
best part about it is that all the codes are explained VERY thouroughly with at least 1 line of 
explanation for every line of code. there is also an example for each sub just in case someone is new
and doesn't know how to use bas functions. this bas was made for all the new vb users who are kicked
around by experienced vb users, just like i was in the beggining. aight, hope you like this 1 guys

cya,
y0shi

note: for all you experienced proggers, i'll be releasing a y0shi bas with more complex stuff, but
      most of this is for everyone in general. if you lookin' for experienced stuff, go look at dos's
      bas and go copy his aol codes. also note that this bas wasn't intended for aol proggin', i just
      added some aol codes so that people could learn how to use the different api's.

note: this was tried in vb6 so if there are any probz in vb 5, 4, or 3, don't bug me about it

note: the zone codes might not work, i made em a while ago so i don't know if the windows are diff. now
