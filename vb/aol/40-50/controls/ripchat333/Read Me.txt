***************************- EXAMPLES -******************************

This Chat Control/Scanner is very simple to use.  To turn it on, 
type: Chat1.ScanOn in either Form_Load or in a command button.
From there you put your codeing in the Chat scanner.  It works 
like this; every time the the last chat line in the chat room 
appears, the chat scanner fires.  Who = the Screen name from the
last person to talk in the chat room, and What = what they said
(Last Chat Line).  It's that easy!!!

 
Example1:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase("Hi") Then
  Chat1.ChatSend "Hello " & Who & "!"
  End If
  End Sub

Example2:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase(".imoff") And Who = UserSN() Then
  Call InstantMessage("$IM_OFF", "Turn IMz off")
  End If
  End Sub

Example3:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  Dim Person As String
  If Who = GetUser() And InStr(LCase(What), LCase(".x")) Then
  Person = Right(What, Len(What) - 2)
  Chat1.IgnorePerson Person&
  Timeout 0.3
  Chat1.ChatSend "- --|[ " + Person& + " - IGNORED!"
  Exit Sub
  End If
  End Sub

Example4(Server):

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase("/" & UserSN & " Send List") Then
  List1.Additem "" & Who
  Chat1.ChatSend Who & ", request received!"
  End If
  End Sub
