<ul>
 <li>It is very important to get the maximum value you can in the
     left part of the score table, in particular to get at least 63 points, so
     you can have the 35 points bonus.</li>
 <li>To sum 63 points you have to get 3 times every number from 1 to
     6. If you have to fill a box with a lower number of dice, you should try
     to get more points in the other boxes. The aces box can be useful if you
     have to mark a lower score, or a 0.</li>
 <li>Try to keep the chance box empty as long as possible, it will
     be very useful in the last moments of the game.</li>
 <li>If the game is about to end, and if you have to score a 0, try
     to mark it in the Yahtzee or in the maximum scale boxes, because these are
     the most difficult to mark with points.</li>
 <li>

<p>Try to mark 3 of a kind and 4 of a kind
with high values, because you score the sum of all the 5 dice.</p>

 </li>
