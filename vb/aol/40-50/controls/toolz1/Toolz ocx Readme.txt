This is the ocx I made for AOL4.0.With this you can send chat,IM's,and mail.It is version 1.It was made for VB5 and should work with VB4 if you have the VB5 runtime files.The 3 functions of this ocx are the 3 main functions you need to make a program for AOL4.0.I haven't made anything for AOL in 9 months because I was bored with AOProggin.I have to give a big SHOUT OUT to DoS for the motivation to make this.When he made his ocx it got me interested in AOL again.

To send chat with the ocx all you do is in a command button put:
Toolz1.Say_It ("What you want to say here")

For sending IM's it's:
Toolz1.IM_It  ("SN, What you want to say")

For sending mail its:
Toolz1.Mail_It ("SN,Subject,What you want to say")
or use 3 textboxes and:
Toolz1.Mail_It Text1.Text,Text2.Text,Text3.Text

I am working on version2 now in it there will be an IM scan to get the SN and message from the IM.And I have a couple more ideas.
