-----------------(How to use ChatFader.ocx by Azazel)------------------
	   126 different fades (unless I miscounted :D)

(*1*)   If you are using Visual Basic 4.0, then you will not be able to 
see the fades this has I believe.  In Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0, a list 
drops down to let you see all the subs & functions certain things 
contain.  No need to werry now...  Read at the bottom for all the fades 
this has and how you can use them.  (This was programmed in VB6).

(*2*)   This is fairly easy to use.  Since it werks for both AIM and
AOL Chat rooms, I made AIM as a boolean, which means, if you want to 
send to AIM, you put "True", if you want to send to AOL you put "False".

ex:  Call Fader1.BlackBlue("Message!", True)
     ' That will send to AIM

ex:  Call Fader1.BlackBlue('Message!", False)
     ' That will send to AOL

(*3*)   This will only werk in chat rooms, but please, don't werry!  
There will soon be an IMFader.ocx that werks for AIM and AOL, and there
will also be a MailFader.ocx which will only be able to werk for AOL 
since there is no mail on AIM.  I will be upgrading these to higher 
version with more fades and less bugs.  I really don't think there are
any bugs in this ocx because I have tested it out, maybe I mis-typed
something by accident, but that's the most that would happen.  if you 
find any problems, ways of contacting me are:
