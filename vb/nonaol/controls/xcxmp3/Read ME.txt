Well this is my mp3 ocx file.  This ocx plays mp3s and
gets info from the mp3s.  For example you can get the 
tile of the mp3.  You can write on the mp3s.  For example
you can let the user type The title of the mp3 and use 
a function on this ocx.  Like what winamp can do.  If you
have any questions email me at magic@proggz.8m.com
