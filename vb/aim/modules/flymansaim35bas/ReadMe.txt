Hello,Thanks for getting this .bas From Darc's Site! This is
Flyman the maker of the .Bas talking.
I Really rather not get ims asking api help
for those who do know my sn you know I do not like those
questions.Also for those ho want to talk my aim sn is: Tourq.
This .bas was made for aim3.5,and all the lower versions of aim.
I also made this codes able to use screen names so you don't
have to send a file/direct connect etc,to the open im,i have it
so you can type what im to send it to!
Also I included The subs you can use for those newbies
that are really not sure how to use a module(.bas).
Well thank you! Bye.
