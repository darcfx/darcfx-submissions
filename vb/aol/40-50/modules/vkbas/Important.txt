Thank you for downloading the Voltron Kru's BAS PACK V.1
These files were all written in VB5. Alot of work went 
into these files. Most of  the VK's programs were made 
using portions of these codes. Voltorn.bas is the core
and is required to be included with any of the others.

example: i want to use VK_AOL.bas 
     (voltron.bas is needed to work VK_Aol.bas they both must 
      be included in the program)

if you have any problems please mail the voltron kru
