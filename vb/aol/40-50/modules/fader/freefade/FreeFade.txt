Free Fade Module by S5o
S5o@hotmail.com

VB16/VB32
Fades a form, between any 2 user defined RGB Colors.

Important:
To use this module, true RGB colors will not operate, The user must use the `FadeColor' custom type.

Note:
1] The `vFreeFade' sub fades the color from top to bottom, while `hFreeFade' fades the form left to right.
2] This module was completely coded in 2 hours, and you may find some situations that may cause irregular      fades (Which has not occured thus far).


'Example:
'----------------------------------------------------------------
Private Sub Form_Load ()
'This code fades the from from Cyan to blue

Dim sColor as FadeColor
Dim eColor as FadeColor

'Define the first color
sColor.Blue=255
sColor.Green=255

'Define the second color
eColor.Blue=255

'Call the vertical form fade
Call vFreeFade (Me, sColor, eColor)

End Sub
