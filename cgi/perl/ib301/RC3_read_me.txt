Updating to the latest RC3 revision
...................................

Uploading the new files.
--------------------------------

Read the file in this folder called "RC3_changed_files.txt" to determine which files
need updating. Extract the tar files locally and simply upload these extracted files 
that are listed in "RC3_changed_files.txt" to your server - its safe to overwrite the
ones on your server.

Also, don't forget to update "ikonboard.cgi".
