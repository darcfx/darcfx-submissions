This is my popup menu example.  I felt i had to do one because all
the others are so crap.  This shows how to make menu items bold, 
explains the popupmenu function properly, how to position the menu
correctly, how to take the menu from another form and how to make
the menu only appear when certain mouse buttons are pressed.

If you want to talk to me for any reason you can normally find me
on EFnet #Discotheque as mash-
