Updating to the latest GOLD revision
...................................

Step 1: Uploading the new files.
--------------------------------

Read the file in this folder called "GOLD_changed_files.txt" to determine which files
need updating. Extract the tar files locally and simply upload these extracted files 
that are listed in "GOLD_changed_files.txt" to your server - its safe to overwrite the
ones on your server.

Also, don't forget to update "ikonboard.cgi" - if you don't, the search won't work.

If you do encounter errors after upgrading, check to make sure you've updated all the files
that are listed. If in doubt, upgrade all the files (with the exception of "Skin/Default/Styles.pm".
