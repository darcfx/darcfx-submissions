Program Name: Shapeaform
Version: 2.0

Program's Function:
Lets you customize the same of a form in vb.

Things to note:
* Make sure you declare all the api functions that this program uses.
  A list of them to copy is provided in the help section (on the
  About/help tab)
* Put the code the program generates in the load event of the form.
* VB may freeze up if you move a form with a really complex shape 
  around a lot at run time, but this shouldn't happen when the project 
  is compiled into an exe.

How to get a form to draw on:
First Way:  Click the "Get Form" button, then in the next 10 seconds
            click on the form you want to draw on (a picture will be
            taken of that form).
Second Way: Click down on the picture of the mouse (next to the "Get
            Form" button) and drag it onto the form you want.

***Using multipule shapes:
Inorder to shape a form to more then one shape, you have to stain the
first shape you drew onto the image. To do this just right click on the
picture and select "Stain." Once you stain a shape on the form you
cannot remove it. The only way to get rid of it is to get the image
again. Once the image is stained, just start working with the new 
shape.

Moving the shape with the arrow keys:
(only works on the Ovals tab) If you want, you can adjust the shape 
using the arrow keys when on the oval tab.

Shape a form to a bitmap:
Get the picture of the form you want to shape. Then push the "Create
Code For Bitmap Outline" button, when the dialog box appears select the
color you want to be transparent (drag the mouse onto the color), and
push the "Create Code" button.

API functions this program uses:
CombineRgn - Takes two regions and puts them together to form a new one.
CreateEllipticRgn - Creates a region in the shape of an oval based on
                    the rectangle you create with the X and Y points.
CreatePolygonRgn - Creates a region based on an array of points.
CreatePolyPolygonRgn - Creates a region made up of other polygons.
CreateRectRgn - Creates a region in the shape of a rectangle.
