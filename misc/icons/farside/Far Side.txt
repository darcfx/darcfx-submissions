The Far Side Collection
by Ronald A. Watson

The Far Side Collection, as the name implies, is a collection of icons based 
on characters from The Far Side Cartoons by Gary Larson.  I created them 
with ResEdit 2.1.1.  Consider these e-mail ware, if you like them then I 
hope you'll feel a deep sense of obligation to e-mail me.  You can e-mail me 
at "FeatrStone" on America Online or at "FeatrStone@aol.com" on the 
internet.  I had a great time creating these icons, I hope you enjoy them, 
and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Ronald A. Watson   a.k.a  FeatherStone

- May you find yourself awake in your dreams.
