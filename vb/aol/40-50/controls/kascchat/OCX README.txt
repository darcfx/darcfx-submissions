-- C-Com OCX Recognizer
--- This ocx will recognize commands from the chat room.
---- This ocx has three properties you need:
---- 1: timeractivate - set to true to begin looking for text
---- 2: commandtext - the command in the string in the chat room... if by you.
---- 3: argtext - the argument following the command in the chat room... if by you.

EX:

.imunx mrman

imunx is going to be the commandtext,

and mrman is going to be the argument text.

Good Luck

Oh, and if you could tell me how to put an about box on the ocx, please do..
thanks,

KaS
