Ok, this is the source to my recently released server.... here's a few notes:

1.) THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IF YOU READ ANYTHING READ THIS! ok the server is some what unstable that problem can be easily solved.... instead of killing the status window resize it if you can understand all the coding then that should be easily done

2.) Yes i realize the coding is sloppy i appologize for that

3.) Any questions email me at: itz_kid@hotmail.com
