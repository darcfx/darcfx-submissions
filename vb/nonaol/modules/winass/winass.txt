 This module contains the ultimate in windows api and windows programming.
It is made specifically to manipulate files and do things that normal
modules would never even come close to doing.
Examples:

1.  ChangeWallpaper
2.  CheckForSoundCard
3.  DeleteFile
4.  Recycle file
5.  SetReadOnly
6.  SetNormal
7.  SetHidden
8.  PrintTextFile
9.  SaveTextBox
10. SaveComboBox
11. SaveListBox

These are only 11 of the 130+ Procedure on this module.

 Along with the windows api,
this module also is a GREAT source for your project's iface. Just to list
a couple:

1. makes forms 3d
2. makes objects pannel in and out
3. makes 3d objects
4. special color effects
5. fade the backround color of a form to almost any color

and much much more.

-new versions of the bas file come out regurly
-old procedures from previous versions will work
