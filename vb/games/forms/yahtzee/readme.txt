Yahtzee Help Readme
------------------------------------------------------------

  This is the compiled help source.  The help was made with
Microsoft HTML Help Workshop v1.2, you can d/l it from MS's
website, which is about a 4 megs d/l or so.  Once installed
you can open this help project.  This is my first time making
a .chm help file so I am sure it can be made better, but at
this time I am unaware of exactly how it all works.  I spent
about 30 mins on this on this help file so it's just the basics.
I used a class file from http://www.vbexplorer.com to implement
the use of the .chm file in VB.  

NOTICE:  This directory is not needed for the game for anyone
who doesn't already know.  I just thought you might want the
source to the help as well.  All you need is the compiled
help file in the source codes directory.
