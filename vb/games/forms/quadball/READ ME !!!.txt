|Last Min notes: (for source code) |
|----------------------------------|
|
| This was written In VB6 so i'm not sure if it will work in vb5,
| IF YOU ARE USING VB5 INSTALL "PICCLP32.OCX" BY GOING INTO THE 
| "SOURCE" DIRECTORY AND DOUBLE CLICKING ON THE FILE "INSTPCPL.BAT"
|
| if it doesn't just download "vb6run.exe" form the microsoft site
| and then you will at least be able to play the compiled Exe's.
|
| For the complied exe's to work all the ".exe" , ".Img" and ".Qbs"
| must be in the same directory.
| 
| Please Note That This FreeWare can be placed on magazine Cds as long as
| Arvinder Sehmi is notified ( arvinder@bigfoot.com )
|
| If There are any problems, or if you have any comments , questions or
