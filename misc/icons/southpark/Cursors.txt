These are 256-color Animated Cursors: Be sure to have your Settings at
"HIGH COLOR(16-bit)" or Greater, and your Icons set at "Large".

For "HIGH-COLOR":  Be sure your Monitor can display SVGA FIRST! (over 256 colors). 
(You should already know this.  I can't tell you.  Odds are good that if you
bought a Pentium computer (with a new monitor), you can, but you never know.)

Click the "START"(Button), pick "SETTINGS", "CONTROL PANEL",
 choose "Display Properties".  
Pick the "Settings" Tab.
Use the dropdown menu under the words "Color Palette" to select 
"High Color (16 bit).
Now hit the "Apply" button.  If prompted to, "ShutDown" and "Restart" the computer.

* (Always use the "ShutDown" Menu!! NEVER just turn a Windows95 Computer Off!!!!)



For "LARGE ICONS":

Click the "START"(Button), pick "SETTINGS", "CONTROL PANEL", choose "Display Properties".
Pick the "PLUS!" Tab.  Check the box that says "USE LARGE ICONS". If prompted to, "ShutDown" 
and restart the computer.

(Note that if you're changing BOTH of the above Settings, you can do Both of them, and 
then do the "Shutdown/Restart" thing Once.)




Quick instructions for putting 'South Park' Animated Cursors into your Desktop:


To Change a Pointer, Adjustment Cursor, or the "Wait/Busy" Animation do the following...

Click the "START"(Button), pick "SETTINGS", "CONTROL PANEL", "MOUSE", 
then the "POINTERS" Tab. 

Double-click on the Cursor you want to REPLACE and 'Browse' your files for the one 
you want to use as its replacement. (It's in whatever folder you put my 'South
Park' ANI files in.)

Select the one you want, then hit "Apply".

Repeat as needed.

You can then save your choices by clicking "SAVE AS" (Scheme) and picking 
a name for it.


*  Note that the "Preview" of the Animation that Windows shows is running a bit 
   slower than the actual Animation will on your Desktop, once "Applied".

A quick way to check each Animation (assuming you don't have MicroAngelo)
is to RIGHT-CLICK on the ANI file and select "PROPERTIES".
(Again the "Preview" will run much more slowly than the actual "Applied" Animation,
but at least you get to see it without having to actually Apply each one!)

Good Luck!  Any Questions?  Well, read the Win95 Manual!!!!! (Really!)
