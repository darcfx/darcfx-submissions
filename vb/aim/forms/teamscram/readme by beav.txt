this file was made by beav
it was made cause GLeeT 
said he needed a team scrambler
example, so i made this for 
aim, he said he needed one for
aim, so you will need Quirks
aim ocx, it really kicks ass
and is included in the zip
this has all the fix's and works
fine, it has been tested by:
oxidine, izekial83, ME, and others
so it does work, it may take some
modification to fit your program
but works FINE
i give credit to QuiRK because
it would not be here without his
scan, and his ocx, i use his ocx
