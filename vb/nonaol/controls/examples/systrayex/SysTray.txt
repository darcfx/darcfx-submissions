ABOUT:
This control was made by Nathan Blecharczyk. Its purpose is to display an icon on the system tray (the area in the bottom, right hand corner of the screen on Windows 95). If you have any question, comments, suggestions, or are interested in the source code for this program please e-mail me at b_nathan@juno.com.

To use the system Tray control you must first copy systray.ocx to your Windows system directory. Then, from Visual Basic right click on the toolbox and select "Components." Now click browse and locate and scroll down until you see systray.ocx. Now you can use the control in your project.
