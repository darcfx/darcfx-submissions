Icon Explorer 2 allows you to quickly extract all the icons from a specified folder or file. This is mainly useful for developers wanting to use the icons in their own programs, but you should always check the copyright restrictions by the original authors.

No installation is needed to run Icon Explorer 2; just run the program file from the folder that you extract the zip archive to.

By default, all the icons in a folder are shown. You can change this using the settings dialog box. By selecting the "Show only icons in a file" option, a list of files rather than icons is shown in the right pane. You can then double-click on one of these files to see the icons within it. This is most useful when using Icon Explorer on a slow computer or when looking at folders which contain a lot of icons, such as Windows\System.

To save an icon, click on the box to the side of it to place a tick mark in it. When you click on Save, all the icons which are ticked are saved. You can change which folder they are saved to, and in which format they are saved, in the Settings dialog.
