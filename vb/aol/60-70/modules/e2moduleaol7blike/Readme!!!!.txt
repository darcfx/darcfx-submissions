Welcome to the E2 Community Module Project.


The E2 Community Module is a module specifically designed for AOL7.0 and windows XP. This module was designed to be user-maintained. The functions and subs you find in this module are user-submitted. An updater has been included that will automatically update your version of the module to keep it fresh and working. It has a scheduled update once a week, but fixes and tweaking updates happened almost every day.

Users are strongly encouraged to send their own subs and functions. This project CANNOT continue without your support. All user-submitted functions and subs will be tagged with your name, URL, and email. You can also include other comments in the code. 


*****Please be sure to include the following in ALL your submissions:
YOUR NAME (REQUIRED)
Public declarations(uness the module already provides them)...
controls, objects, or other things that need to be present for the code to function properly...
ANY COMMENTS YOU WISH TO MAKE
**********************************************************************

Most computers have the required OCX files to run the updater..

They are available at the E2 Project Homepage if you need them:
