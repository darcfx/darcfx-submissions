dbread.dll is a C++ written DLL to retrieve various AOL information
from the AOL MAIN.IDX that you can use with your programs  =)

You can use this DLL anyway you like, give it to as many people
as you want, use it in any program you want, but don't as for the
source code or how I did any of these functions.  Those are some of
my secrets!  =)
