The second edition FF2 'handbook'     -courtesy of Ben Siron  9/19/95

a.k.a. 'bensiron@cco.caltech.edu'



thanks to Adam Lederman for all of the information in his FF2 guide.  it gave

me a lot of ideas on things to research, which I present in this new guide in

addition to all the non-game genie information which he originally compiled



recent thanks to 'D', who can be contacted using the email address

'slmry@cc.usu.edu'.  'D' gave me corrected physical and magical damage

algorithms, although I still can't verify how any of the defense and % abilities

work. 'D' also gave me useful info about the effects of conditions like 'curse'

and the special abilities of certain classes, and this was enough of a headstart

to attempt and exhaustive list of conditions and special abilities. finally,

there are numerous other corrections to damage ranges and special items in this

version which are due to 'D'



if you find anything amiss, missing, or badly explained (however trivial) with

this guide, E-mail me, and I'll take note of it. E-mail me also if you find out

any really cool tips, strategies, etc...



(this listing was made in an evenly spaced font, lines 80 characters wide,

with 8 characters per tab)

Statistics:	STR - strength		AGI - agility

		VIT - vitality		WIS - wisdom

		WILL - willpower	MHP - maximum hit points

		MMP - maximum magic points

		RHP - remaining hit points (current health value)

		ATT - attack value	A% - hit %

		xA - attack multiplier

		DEF - defense value	D% - defend %

		xD - defense mutiplier	M% - magic evasion %

		MD - magic resistance value

		xM - magic resistance multipler

		LV - level



basic stats - the statistics of STR, AGI, VIT, WIS, and WILL.  these are not

		derived from any other statistic, but they can be modified by

		equipment



derived stats - the statistics of ATT, A%, xA, DEF, xD, D%, MD, xM, and M%.

		these are completely determined by basic stats, LV, and what is

		being equipped



(DMG) - this special effect means that the attack ignores the effects of

		target's armor or resistance.



(secret) - this item is very hard to find: you have to be lucky and win it

		in battle.  very likely, you will play through an entire game

		without ever finding this item



(sneak) - if you have a ninja in your party, he can 'sneak' items from the

		enemies.  the success rate of this depends on relative agility

		ratings



(dummy) - this item was taken out of the american or later versions of the

		game (for some unknown reason), and you can't get it unless you

		have a game genie (the code still exists to handle the item,

		though)



Mathematical notation:

	[x] = the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

			for instance, [ (57/4) ] = [ 14.25 ] = 14, 

			where  /  indicates division.

	(x,y) represents a range of possible point values,

			not less than (x) and not more than (y)

			for instance (200,300) means anything between 200 and

			300, including 200 and 300 (the endpoints)

	(...)k represents that amount in thousands. for example, 100k

			means 100,000



target - some place that you can cast a spell to, attack, use an item on, etc...

		ex. - your allies and your enemies are targets in a battle



enemy - a target in battle which is on the left side or on the right side if you

		are attacked from behind.  a charmed enemy is still an enemy.

		an enemy of an enemy is an ally.  an ally of an enemy is an

		enemy



ally - a target which is not an enemy.  a charmed ally is still an ally.



phase - the unit of time inside of a battle during which the 'count' condition

		is decremented (very short; 1-2 of these happen between actions

		of each character



turn - the unit of time inside of a battle required for all participants to take

		an action



HP leak - target creature continues to lose HP after the initial attack at a

		rate of (1,16) HP per phase for about 4 turns



attack - any action taken inside of a battle, except for COVER/OFF, HIDE/SHOW,

		CHANGE, (run away), and PARRY



physical attack - any attack which is carried out by using the ATTACK, JUMP,

		KICK, AIM, or DART option



magical attack - any attack which is carried out by using the BLACK, WHITE,

		CALL, NINJA, ITEM, SING, PEEP, or TWIN option



c.a. - counterattack: this technique will be used immediately(even if the game

		is paused) by the creature whenever it is attacked in a certain

		way, but is not eliminated by the attack.  the target of the

		counterattack doesn't have to be the original attacker



ca:p - counterattack to physical attacks



ca:m - counterattack to magical attacks



outside - the state of wandering around on the overland map (not being in a

		town, dungeon, in battle, etc...)



heal - when this word is in lowercase, it means that any damage this attack

		inflicts is instead added to the target's HP, unless the target

		is undead, in which case the heal attack does damage like any

		other attack.  when this word is used in uppercase, it refers

		to either the spell or the item called 'HEAL', which has a

		totally different effect







======================= 1: STATISTICAL & DAMAGE ALGORITHMS =====================



- - - -=- -=- DAMAGE CALCULATION ALGORITHMS -=- -=- - - -

the results of nearly all attacks which produce damage are derived from a

few numbers, the base, the 'damage multiplier' ('d.m.'), xA, and the defense of

the target (MD or DEF)



exceptions: the DART ability which is available to your ninja, and special

	attacks which do damage based on the MHP of the target



Physical Attacks:

the base is the attacking character's ATT.  if using the dragoon's 'JUMP'

option, double the base.  double the base again if the target of the attack is

'small' or a 'toad'.  if the attacker is 'berserk', multiply the base by 3/2.

finally, if the attacker has 'curse', cut the base power in half

to get the 'd.m.' for a physical attack, start with 1.  if the weapons being

used have elements associated with them which apply to the elemental multipliers

of the target, take the biggest such one and multiply the 'd.m.' by that number

(if the biggest such one is negative, ignore it completely).  if the weapons

being used have race multipliers (such as x4 vs.dragons), take the biggest such

one and multiply the 'd.m.' again by that number.



Magical Attacks:

every spell or item has a base peculiar to it, as listed in the following parts.

to get the 'd.m.' for a magical attack, also start with 1.  if the

attack has an element associated with it which applies to the elemental

multipliers of the target, multiply the 'd.m.' again by this number

(if this number is negative, ignore it for now, but at the end of this

algorithm, change the sign of the damage to be negative).  an ally which is the

target of an elemental magic attack from another ally always takes x4 damage, so

the elemental multiplier is always 4 in this case



from this, let Z = ( base, [ base x 3/2 ] ) x 'd.m.'

*BUG: if the attack is magical and the base is derived from the RHP of the

caster, the random range of Z cannot be more than 255.  Formally speaking,

Z would be ( base, Max{ [ base x 3/2 ], base + 255 } ) x 'd.m.'.  so, if you

cast 'MIST' with an RHP of 3500, the random range of Z would be (1750,2005), and

NOT (1750,2625)



if the attack is (DMG), the target does not get a chance to stop it and we let

N = Z.  otherwise,

for a magical attack, let N = Z - (0,MD), unless the attack is made by an ally

against an ally, in which case the target does not resist and N = Z

for a physical attack, let N = Z - (0,DEF)



in the case of a magical attack, let xP = either the effective black or white

magic multiplier (as explained in the 'magic' section), or the constant

multiplier which is peculiar to an item being used.  multiply N by a number

between 0 and xP.  this function eludes me, but it is close to

xP - ((xM) x (M%)).  if the attack is made by an ally against an ally, the

target does not resist, and we multiply N by xP



if N < 1 then N = 1



in the case of a physical attack, multiply N by a number between 0 and xA.  the

exact function also eludes me, but it depends on xA, xD, %A, %D, and bonuses for

being in the front rows or not.  on average, it is ((xA) x (A%)) - ((xD) x (D%))



if N > 9999, then N = 9999, except in rare circumstances which are explained

individually



finally, if the attack is a draining type attack (such as casting PSYCH or

swinging the DRAIN sword), and the target is undead, make the sign of N

negative (DON'T DRAIN UNDEAD!!).



the effective damage done by the attack to the target is N.  if N is negative,

then most likely the attack will heal the target



sometimes during a physical attack the screen will flash, indicating a critical

hit.  I don't know what effect this has in the algorithm





- - - -=- -=- STATISTICAL ALGORITHMS -=- -=- - - -

here are the ways in which derived stats are obtained from LV and the basic

stats; consider the value of the basic stats to be what they are after being

modified by equipment (as is shown to you on the statistical info subscreen):



let the level bonus be known as 'LB' = [ LV/4 ], except for the karate man, for

which 'LB' = (LV + 1) x 2.  let the strength bonus be known as 'SB' = [ STR/4 ].

let the vitality bonus be known as 'VB' = [ VIT/2 ].



ATT = LB + SB + (weapon power).  if the character is ambidextrous and is

equipping a different weapon in either hand, ATT = LB + SB + (left weapon power)

+ LB + SB + (right weapon power).  if the character is equipping a bow & arrows

and the arrows are in that character's good hand, ATT = (arrow power) + (bow

power) + SB; if the arrows are in the weak hand multiply this ATT value by 4/5

(this penalty does not apply to ambidextrous characters).  if the character is

equpping a two-handed weapon, it does not matter what hand the weapon is in, or

whether the character is ambidextrous or not: ATT = LB + SB + (weapon power)



xA = [ STR/8 ] + [ AGI/16 ] + 1



A% = 50% + [ LV/4 ] + (weapon bonus to A%.  if the character is ambidextrous and

is equipping two weapons, the bonus to A% is the average of the two bonuses)



DEF = VB + (sum of all DEF armor ratings)



xD = [ AGI/8 ] + ( [ LV/16 ] if a shield is equipped)



D% = 30% + (sum of all D% armor bonuses)



MD = (sum of all MD armor ratings)



xM = [ (WIS + WILL)/32 ] + [ AGI/32 ]



M% = [ (WIS + WILL)/8 ] + (sum of all M% armor bonuses)







======================= 2: ACTIONS AND CHARACTER CLASSES =======================



character classes are the main way in which the characters in your party have

differing abilities.  classes determine what weapons and armor can be equipped,

what spells the character can cast and learn, how the character gains in

statistics at every level up, and what other miscellaneous special actions that

the character can use



- - - -=- -=- AVAILABLE ACTIONS -=- -=- - - - 



all classes may use ATTACK, PARRY, (run away), ITEM, or CHANGE as an action in

battle.  in addition to this, certain classes have the following special actions

available to them:



PALADIN (P):		WHITE		COVER/OFF

DRAGOON (D):		JUMP

DK.KNIGHT (K):

CALLER(young) (@):	WHITE		BLACK		CALL

CALLER(mature) (C):	BLACK		CALL

SAGE (S):		WHITE		BLACK

KARATE MAN (K):		KICK

BARD (B):		HIDE/SHOW	SING

ENGINEER(chief) (E):	PEEP

WH.WIZ (W):		WHITE		AIM(rosa only)	TWIN(palom only)

BL.WIZ (B):		BLACK		TWIN

LUNARIAN (L):		WHITE		BLACK

NINJA (N):		DART		SNEAK		NINJA



ATTACK - launch a basic physical attack at any available target

PARRY - do nothing; during this time and until this character gets another

  prompt to take an action, defense in increased in some way i'm not sure of

CHANGE - all allies in the back row move to the front row and vice versa

ITEM - use an item in the party's inventory, change equipment in the left and/or

  right hand of the character taking this action, move items around, and/or use

  an equipped weapon as an item

(run away) - this option is not listed, but it can be used at any time by

  holding down the left & right buttons.  this will only be successful if at

  least one ally is available to take an action(or is already taking an action),

  you are not in a subcreen of the main action window, and the game is not

  paused.  you can also quit trying to run away at any time by releasing the

  left & right buttons, at which time you may give the ally who is ready a

  different action.  if (run away) is successful, the battle will be aborted and

  you may lose an amount of gold exactly equal to 1/4 what you would have won if

  you had stayed and fought

WHITE - shows a listing of all white spells that the character knows

BLACK - shows a listing of all black spells that the character knows

NINJA - shows a listing of all ninja spells ...

CALL - shows a listing of all call spells ...

COVER - attempt to intercept most physical attacks aimed at a chosen ally by an

  enemy and become the target of the attack instead.  the paladin will

  automatically COVER any fatigued ally (one with HP =< [ MHP/4 ])

OFF - cancels the previous COVER directive

JUMP - leap high into the air to launch a physical attack against a single enemy

  target with double the normal base ATT value.  a JUMP takes a full turn to

  execute, and while in the air the dragoon may not be the target of any kind

  attack.  all attacks which are directed to target the dragoon before a JUMP,

  but are not executed until the dragoon is already in the air will be

  ineffective or will target a different ally

PEEP - this has the same effect as the white spell of PEEP, but it's free

AIM - a bow & arrow must be equipped to be able to use this action.  AIM makes a

  physical attack as is normally done at single target, except that A% becomes

  99%.  AIM has no extra side costs that I can see, so it seems to be superior

  to the ATTACK option in every way

DART - sacrifice a weapon in the party's inventory to cause exactly

  LV(of ninja) x (power of weapon) + (1,100) points of (DMG) to a single target.

  the special abilities and elemental attributes of the weapon that you use as a

  dart are irrelevant.  you could target an ally with this action, but the

  attack would be ineffective, and you would still lose the weapon forever

SNEAK - attempt to steal an item from a target.  if the target is slow, has

  'stop','paralyze', or 'sleep', or your ninja is fast, the chances of this

  attack being successful are increased.  the type of item stolen will always be

  the same for a given type of monster, and is listed further on.  a successful

  SNEAK from a given monster does not in any way decrease the chances of being

  able to SNEAK from that same monster again.  you can potentially SNEAK an

  infinite number of items from a given monster.  SNEAK may be targetted against

  an ally or an enemy boss, but it is never effective in these instances.  the

  SNEAK attack is neither magical nor physical

TWIN - either palom or porom may initate this action if both characters are in

  your party and have the capability to cast at least a 10 point magic spell

  (i.e. neither has 'mute','swoon','stone','pig', etc...).  once chosen, the

  other ally will terminate whatever action that has been started, and they will

  both begin casting either FLARE or COMET.  if either ally is incapacitated

  in the process of casting, TWIN will be aborted.  the effects of TWIN when

  cast successfully are listed in the magic section

HIDE - if HIDE is used, the ally may not be the target of any attack, and any 

  attack that was targetted at the hidden ally before HIDE was executed will

  fail or be redirected to another ally, as is the case with JUMP.  the only

  action available to a hidden ally is SHOW

SHOW - cancels the previous hide directive

KICK - launches a physical attack against all enemy targets.  i'm not sure

  exactly how this works

SING - ?







================================= 3: CONDITIONS ================================



there are 19 different ways to alter a character so that the change appears

as a change in status (that I know of):



			WALL

			D

			PETRIFY

			COUNT

			STOP

			BERSERK

			CHARM

			SLEEP

			PARALYZE

			FLOAT

			CURSE

			POISON

			DARKNESS

			MUTE

			PIG

			SMALL

			TOAD

			STONE

			SWOON



a character may have several of these conditions simultaneously, but the status

window will only show the one that is lowest (most severe) on the list.  the

other reason I have given the 19 conditions in a specific order is that for the

most part, one condition cannot be set if the target already has a condition

that is more severe (lower on the list).  ex- if the target is 'mute', and you

try to cast BERSK on it, the spell will be ineffective because you can't set the

'berserk' condition once 'mute' has already been set.  you can however remove

conditions which are less severe than ones the target already has.  ex- if the

target is a 'toad' and a 'pig' at the same time (this is possible if you first

cast PIGGY on it, and then TOAD), you can still use PIGGY to remove the 'pig'

condition.  there are a few exceptions to this severity rule:

  - stop, wall, count and poison may be set over anything but stone or swoon

  - any condition may be set over float

  - any permanent condition may be set over any other permanent condition if

    the action is done outside of battle 



in the explanation of these conditions, 'nP' means non-permanent.  it may not

  exist or persist outside of battle. 'Pm' means permanent.  this condition will

  stay with the target until it is actively removed, and may even persist if the

  target swoons and is revived later



WALL:nP: a 'wall' lasts for about 1-2 turns and will reflect many kinds of

  magical attacks so that the spell ends up targetting an enemy of the original

  target instead.  a wall will not reflect an attack which already been

  reflected once.  most attacks which only target multiple targets may not be

  reflected.  Reflectable: all black & white spells except PEEP,QUAKE,METEO,

  the special monster attacks of MEGANUKE,EMISSION,COUNT(fataleye),DISRUPT, the

  ninja magic of PIN, all weapons used as items except DANCING(knife).

  Not Reflectable: all call spells, all other ninja spells, all other black &

  white spells, the special monster attacks of ENTANGLE,(2xattack),

  BLIZZARD(blue d.),CURSE(d.fossil),PETRIFY(blackliz), NEEDLE(swordrat), and all

  other item use.

  any other special monster attacks which I have not listed as either

  Reflectable or not I am not sure about.

  a 'wall' is only visible when it is cast or triggered and appears as a round

  crystal shield in front of the target.



D:nP: 'D' is probably a bug resulting in a mismatched character string for this

  condition.  if a target has 'D', it is 1/3 of the way to becoming 'stone', and

  will gradually move on to the 'petrify' condition by waiting long enough.  'D'

  has no ill side effects and is visible by the target being gray below the

  waist



PETRIFY:nP: 'petrify' means that the target is 2/3 of the way to becoming

  'stone', and will gradually move on to the 'stone' condition by waiting long

  enough.  'petrify' has no ill side effects and is visible by the target being

  either totally grey or grey below the shoulders



COUNT:nP: a 'count' begins at 10 and is decremented at every phase, unless the

  target also has 'stop'.  if it is decremented while at zero, the target will

  'swoon'.  'count' is visible as a green two-digit number which sits over the

  target's head and is updated as count as decremented



STOP:nP: 'stop' means that the target may take no actions and is also more

  vulnerable to magical and physical attacks, as well as the ninja ability of

  SNEAK.  the target may spontaneously break out of this condition without

  outside help.  'stop' is only visible when it is cast, and appears as a green

  clock with the minute hands going through four freeze-frames



BERSERK:nP: a 'berserk' target may not be controlled.  the target takes twice as

  many actions as is normal and uses them all for basic physical attacks.  as

  mentioned before, the base power of these physical attacks is multipled by

  3/2.  'berserk' is only visible when it is cast, and appears as a cosmic ray

  which envelops the target from above



CHARM:nP: a target with 'charm' is confused and cannot be controlled.  the

  target will begin to take random actions at a rate twice as often as is

  normal to benefit its enemies and harm its allies.  if the target takes damage

  from a physical attack, 'charm' is removed.  if 'charm' is set, the target

  is freed from the conditions of stop, and berserk.  'charm' is visible as a

  rotating green aura overhead of the target



SLEEP:nP: 'sleep' means that the target may take no actions.  the target may

  spontaneously break out of this condition without outside help.  'sleep' is

  visible as a blue tear dripping out of the eye of the target



PARALYZE:nP: a target with 'paralyze' may take no actions.  the target may

  spontaneously break out of this condition without outside help, unless this

  condition has been automatically imposed by being in cave Magnes with metal

  items equipped before defeating the Dark Elf.  if all characters have

  'paralyze' for this reason, your party will automatically perish immediately

  upon entering battle.  'paralyze' is visible as colorful electricity buzzing

  to either side of the target



FLOAT:quasi-Pm: 'float' disappears if you return to the outside from a battle,

  dungeon, or town, or enter/exit any map.  'float' means that the target is

  immune to QUAKE and TITAN, and does not take damage from floor squares outside

  of battle.  'float' does not grant immunity to stairways or pitfalls.  some

  enemies such as 'eagle' float naturally.  'float' is visible because the

  target will bob up and down in mid-air above an oval shadow



CURSE:Pm: a target with a 'curse' has its base power for physical attacks

  halved, as mentioned before.  'curse' is visible as a black cloud floating 

  overhead



POISON:Pm: a target with 'poison' will lose 1 HP for every step taken outside of

  battle, and inside of battle the target will lose [ MHP/8 ] HP once every

  ( 5+[ VIT/2 ] ) phases.  a target with 'poison' has a purple face



DARKNESS:Pm: 'darkness' means that the target's A% is halved.  a character with

  'darkness' wears shades



MUTE:Pm: 'mute' prevents the target from casting spells.  the target may still

  use items or special monster attacks.  if a target is 'mute', yellow dialogue

  will blink overhead



PIG:Pm: 'pig' prevents the target from casting anything but PIGGY, and prevents

  using the special ability of AIM.  a 'pig' will look like a pig



SMALL:Pm: 'small' reduces the target's ATT to 0.  DEF, Dx, and D% all go

  to 0, and as mentioned before, the bases of all physical attacks against

  'small' targets are doubled.  'small' targets may not use the special

  abilities of DART,COVER,JUMP, or AIM.  a 'small' target will look like a tiny

  doll



TOAD:Pm: 'toad' reduces the target's attack and defenses in the same manner as

  'small'.  in addition, a 'toad' may not cast anything but TOAD, and may not

  use any special abilities peculiar to certain classes.  a 'toad' will look

  like a toad



STONE:Pm: a character with 'stone' may take no actions and may not be target of

  any action besides the HEAL item or spell.  a 'stone' enemy is automatically

  eliminated.  setting the 'stone' condition removes the conditions of count

  and berserk.  if all allies in your party become either 'stone', 'swoon' or

  have automatic 'paralyze' as mentioned before, your entire party perishes

  immediately.  a 'stone' target is completely grey and hunched over, immobile



SWOON:Pm: a character with 'swoon' may take no actions and may not be the target

  of any action besides LIFE1, LIFE2, the LIFE item, or ASURA.  setting the

  'swoon' condition means that HP = 0, and that the conditions of wall, charm,

  count, stop, berserk, paralyze, sleep, and poison are removed.  to 'swoon' is

  to be on the edge of death, face down to the ground







=================================== 4: MAGIC ===================================



BLACK:

the effectiveness of black magic is dependent on the WIS stat of the caster.

some spells have a base damage, which is then multiplied by the black magic

multiplier, B, which is determined as B = [ WIS / 4 ] + 1.



WHITE:

likewise for white magic, the power of the spell is dependent only on WILL.

there is a similar white magic multiplier, W = [ WILL / 4 ] + 1.



some spells can only be cast on a single character (S), some can only be cast on

all allies or all enemies (A), and others you can choose between one target and

multiple ones (S/A).



if you choose to split a (S/A) spell to multiple targets, the total effect will

be divided up equally among the targets by supposing that you had cast the same

spell to each of the targets individually.  if the spell has a multiplier

associated with it, each target recieves the spell with a multipler of the

original divided by the number of targets.  ex.- you cast FIRE3 on 5 targets,

and your caster has WIS = 30.  so B = [ 30/4 ]+1 = 8.  each of the 5 targets

will recieve a FIRE3 spell with a B multiplier of 8/5



certain spells have elemental attributes and/or base numbers associated with

them.  this is indicated in the 'Attribute/Effect' column.  ex- F:24 x B means

that the spell will attack the targets it is aimed at with the element of fire,

a base of 24, and in this case the black magic multiplier will apply to the

damage that is done



an 'nC' abbreviation in the effects column means that the preceding result only

applies outside of combat. a 'Cb' abbreviation means that the preceding result

only applies inside of combat situations.  if the explanation omits to provide a

result for one of the two situations, then this means that the spell is not

available to cast in that situation



other miscellany: the column 'who learns it/when' gives only approximate

levels at which the spell is learned. Z-13 means that a Bl.Wiz would learn the

spell at around level 13. S-(MO) means that the sage learns the spell at mount

ordeals.  C-(SM) means that the caller learns this in the land of summoned

monsters.  # means that the spell is known by the character at the time that

they join your party.  any black or call spell that the young Caller learns is

retained until you meet her in her matured state, but all of the white spell

that the young Caller learns are lost



DONT DRAIN UNDEAD!  PSYCH and DRAIN are draining type spells; if you cast them

on undead, you will give away lots of MP or HP to your enemies!

unique effect - if you use a cure spell outside of battle to heal a single

  target, that target will gain exactly ([WILL/8]+2) x ([WILL/2]+Z) HP, where

  Z is the base power that the spell would have in combat.  if you choose to

  divide the spell, the total healing amount is the same, but it is

  divided equally among all allies.  the only exception is CURE4, which will

  have the same effect outside of combat as it does in combat, if it is cast on

  a single target

================================= 6: MONSTERS ==================================



monsters here are listed first by their race/picture and secondly by the order

in which you meet them in the game.  type can be important in determining

weaknesses. for instance, the ARTEMIS(arrow) is x4 vs. dragons.  'D.Fossil' is

a dragon, so if you shoot those arrows at it, it will take four times as much

damage as it would normally take, as was described in the damage algorithm

section



experience listed is that which you would recieve with 5 characters in your

party, if you were to fight one of those monsters all by itself.  total

experience given is the sum of the experience reward for each one of the

monsters defeated (if they run away before you kill them, they don't count).

if you have fewer than 5 characters in your party, say 3, each one get 5/3 as

many experience points (xp), so that the total experience rewarded remains

constant



money awarded is also additive per monster, and the ones that run away don't

give you anything.  since you only keep one pool of money for your entire

party, this isn't split up



some monsters are weak vs. certain elements.  this will be indicated with an

attribute before the number of HP it has.  one letter for the attribute means

that the monster takes double damage from that element.  two letters means

quadruple damage.  a minus before the letter means that an attack with that

attack with that attribute causes reverse damage.  physical attacks ignore a

negative multiplier.  a '#' sign before the letter means that all attacks with

that element cause 0 damage.  for instance, -F,LL: 250 in the HP column means

that the monster has 250 HP, magical fire attacks will heal it, and it takes

quadruple damage from all lightning attacks



if you have a ninja, he can SNEAK items from enemies during a battle.  what item

you will get from each monster is listed in the 'Sn' column



some monsters have special attacks used in certain circumstances.  what these

attack are and when they are invoked is described in the 'Special Attacks'

column.  a tactic listed in parenthesis and lowercase is a name I have given the

attack because in reality it has no name.  (DMG) which is a fraction of the MHP

of the target and is elemental in nature is always exactly [ MHP/2 ] if the

target is weak vs. that element, and is always exactly [ MHP/10 ] if the target

resists that element.  the effects of these special attacks will be explained

first:





- - - -=- -=- MONSTERS' SPECIAL ATTACKS -=- -=- - - -

Tactic		Effect



(2xattack)	attack twice and resolve both hits at once

ABSORB		monster recovers HP

ALERT		summons another monster

ARMOR		boosts resistance to weapon attacks

BEAK		stone one target

BEAM		(DMG) = [ MHP/10 ] to a single target

BIG BANG	1200(DMG) and HP leak to all allies

BIG WAVE	(DMG) = [ MHP/4 ] to all allies

BLAST		a weak attempt to paralyze one ally

============================= 7: TIPS, TRICKS, ETC. ============================



to duplicate any item which can be equipped in the left or right hand (such as

a shield, sword, rod, axe, etc...), first get into battle, making sure that one

of your characters has the item that you want duplicated equipped.  when that

character's is prompted to take an action, go to your item list, select any

blank space in it, and then select the item you want duplicated(which must be

in the left or right hand).  this will switch the item with the blank space in

the item list.  now leave the item list and then run away from battle.  when you

try to re-equip the item outside of battle, there will be two of them in your

hand at once.  remove the item from your hand again and there will now be two of

them in your item list.



this tactic is especially useful in building up money quickly near the middle

of the game, and is also useful when you get the ninja.  just duplicate the

drain spear or excalibur sword a few times, and throw the extras as darts.

you'll do outrageous amounts of damage, and since it is (DMG), the dart attack

ignores the target's armor.  this makes for a good way to defeat bosses.

unfortunately, you can't duplicate the spoon dart, but if your ninja is above

level 50, the excalibur sword is practically just as effective.  you can pick up

the excalibur sword as soon as the big whale spaceship is available to you.  I

find that a few excalibur darts will make short work out of bahamut, the cpu,

odin, 'plague', etc...  never leave home without them!



to equip any weapon or shield(that your ninja can SNEAK) on any character, first

make sure that you have none of the item that you plan to SNEAK already in your

inventory.  now, enter battle and SNEAK from an enemy that will give you a

weapon or shield.  the next ally available to take an action can now use the

ITEM option to equip the stolen weapon or shield, regardless of whether or not

that ally belongs to the right character class.  this trick only works for

the action immediately following SNEAK, so you should use the FORM option before

entering battle to set things up right so that the desired character follows

after your ninja.  if you decide to remove the stolen equipment at a later time,

you may not put it back on unless that character could normally do so.  in some

cases immediately following the battle in which you execute this trick, your

statistics may not reflect the new piece of equipment.  all you need to do in

this case is go to the equip window, and then you come back to the statistics

window - everything will be alright.  during the battle in which you stole the

equipment, if you try using the equipment as an item, strange things will

happen, the effect usually being guaranteed elimination of one target.  in

subsequent battles, the equipment will act normally if used as an item



this trick is actually not as useful as it sounds, as there isn't much good

stuff that you can SNEAK.  what I find most useful is giving the caller a silver

shield



if you want to find that damned PINK tail(in order to get the ADAMANT armor -

armor which is so unbelievably powerful that it's not even funny), prepare to be

frustrated.  a pink tail can only be obtained from beating a PINKPUFF group, and

the only place that you will ever find a pinkpuff is in a tiny room in B5 of the

Lunar Subterrain.  to find this room, it is best to start from the last chance

saving spot before ZEROMUS on B7.  exit this room and go the left, then back up

two floors so that you will be on the bottom of the screen on B5.  there will be

a small room immediately to the right, and a stairway a little bit further to

the left.  enter the room on the right.  in this room, there should be a

treasure chest on the far right wall which contains a CABIN.  wander around this

room for an eternity and run from everything which is not a pinkpuff(if you have

a game genie, there exists an item to summon a pinkpuff immediately).  there is

a small chance that you will win a PINK(tail) from fighting pinkpuffs.  in the

event that you get lucky and recieve the tail, you can take it to the small dude

who collects tails in the mine southeast of Silvera



make use of weakness multipliers whenever possible.  often, an area will

contain monsters that are weak against the items you can find there.  for

instance, the path to the lunar core has lots of dragons.  near the entrance

you'll have the opportunity to sneak artemis arrows from karys.  take 40 or 50

and shoot them at whatever dragons cross your path.  it will make a big

difference



if you know that one of your party members is going to leave you, remove all

their equipment before they do.  anything they have when they leave you, you

will never see again.  one good example of this is making sure that you keep at

least one defense sword in your item list before your dragoon betrays you in

the sealed cave.  later, you can re-equip him with it, which will be an

improvement over the gungnir spear.  at the very least, you can resell all the

stuff your old characters used to have



i find that it's convienent to move the -sort- option to the top of the item

list.  moving around items is something you're probably going to do a lot, so

you might as well have the option where you can use it



some monsters will only attack if you attack them first (such as behemoth).  so

if you only attack with your strongest characters, and have the rest parry, you

will take less damage.  also, some monsters will constantly use elemental

special attacks if they are alone.  if you are not well protected, you could

easily lose your entire party in seconds.  so, if you run into one such monster

in the company of other monsters, try to kill the ones with the special attacks

first, or get them all at once with a strong magic spell



secret passages are sometimes indicated by dark gray against the black of the

walls.  you may not be able to see them if the brightness on your TV is turned

down.  some secret passages of particular usefulness are in the village of

mist, inside a burned out fireplace.  you can find the rod of change and a

tiara helmet there.  save the tiara for your reunion with your wh.wiz, although

ultimately it will be put to the best use by your caller.  there are also

secret pitfalls in castle eblan, secret passages in the sylvan cave, cave of

summoned monsters, the lunar subterrain and many other places.  one exception

to this pattern is an invisible bridge on the left side of B6 of the Lunar

Subterrain for which there is no indication of a secret passage.  this bridge

leads ultimately to a saving point, and the WYVERN boss who guards the awesome

CRYSTAL sword.  always be on the lookout for secret powerups hidden in jars,

tall grasses, shallow water, and bookshelves too
