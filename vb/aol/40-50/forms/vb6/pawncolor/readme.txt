Yo whud up?  I just started takin Visual Basic classes in school and 
shit so I've been down with the AOL programming thing for a while.  I
love to design web pages, so what I though I needed was a simple html
color coder, so I go to KnK to get one, and alas, I get a cheap piece
of shit that some newbie made.  (i didn't see the one cryo had there) 
So I took it upon myself to redo this one I got off the Forms section.
It is fully funcional with no errors what so ever.  This thing really
helps out.  Sure you can just get the .exe Cryo made, but this is the
exact same as Cryo's plus it has the forms and all.  So here ya go.
