Thanks for downloading utils³.bas by naïve.

This bas has been in 3 versions, and utils² was released somewhere around 2 years ago.
o decided 2 days ago to add on to it and to fix it up, so this is the product of 2 days of
furious coding. i hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

it will compile unless someone changes it, and every variable is now defined, :)

the bas includes 201 subs, this version has 72 new ones, and i took out 1.

later
george
