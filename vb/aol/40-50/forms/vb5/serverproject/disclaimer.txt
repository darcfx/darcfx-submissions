This is the complete source for X-Treme Server '99,It Was written by me for Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0.  If you don't understand the source code,E-Mail Any Question To TiToVb5@Hotmail.com .I provided it for educational use, so you can get a better understanding of windows API And Visual Basic 5.0 .
