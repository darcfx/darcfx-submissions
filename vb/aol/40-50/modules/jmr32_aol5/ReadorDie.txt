My site is http://come.to/GoldnJMR.  I havnt updated it since I left Visual Basic programming about a year ago.  You should see an update soon (Current date is 1/22/00').  Also, if you would like to see something make an appearance in my module drop me a line at XxJMRxX@hotmail.com.  I'm available almost 24 hours a day (ie: whenever the hell i decide to check my mail >;).  I would like to see people make add-on modules for my module, it would be nice, so I give people permission to freely edit my source code.
