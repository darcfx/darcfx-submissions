-Ccom Example-

I made this example because so many people kept on asking me how to make a ccom
so I decided to make an example using Dos32.bas and vb5chat2.ocx because I really
couldn't be bothered to explain it every time and then get people going on at me
if I said I didnt have the time and and tell me they will "own" me.
Maybe Ill release more examples, Ill see how this one goes.
