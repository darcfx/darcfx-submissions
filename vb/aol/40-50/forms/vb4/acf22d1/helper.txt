--This is just a VERY basic example of some AOL coding.
--I made this for a friend who got VB and wanted to
  know some code. Well I made this for him and I decided
  to send it to KnK. It shows how to send chat, send an
  IM, and how to send mail. It also has an example of 
  how to make a mail bomber and a punter. Inside each of
  the command buttons it tells you what the coding does.
--It shows how to use Dos32.bas
--Made in VB4
--Hope you all find this useful. I know a lot of very 
  very newbies will and maybe some begginers who know
  some stuff.
--I will prob make a more complex version later with:
    1. mass imer
    2. mass mailer
    3. server
    And all the basics of a prog.
