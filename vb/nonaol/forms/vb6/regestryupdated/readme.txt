Ok, I know i submitted this once, but when i unzipped it and tried to use it i found my text box wouldent work!!! so i added this file instead of in the form itself. Pease re-post the file with this info.
Well, im submitting my 2nd ever file to KnK. It is an example on how to correctley add your program to the control pannel's sounds options, and read them. I never saw an example for it, so i looked into it. It is very easy and requires next to no code to work. Im supprised no one else has done this. Well, if you want to optomize my code-go ahead. Just dont re-distrubite without my permission.

if the text dosent come up when you load it, here:
  Your probally saying, what the hell is the purpose of this?? Well, now 
exit this form and go into the control panel, open "sounds" and look 
at the bottom. Wow, their is a "KnK" section. Amazing!! Well, not 
really. Now look at the code. Huh?? This looks too easy. Maby, but it 
does work. Try and screw it over, delete KnK, place messed up 
numbers in it. I havent found anything that can mess it up. It also 
dosent require any external source to write KnK. It wont crash. Before 
loading/unloading it first checks for the refrence in the registry, if it is there 
it uses it. If not, it creates a empty refrence. Look at my coding to see 
what area of the registry it modifys. I think this is one of the best ways to 
let a user select sound options. It practically lets the user do all work!! And it 
is faster, and less intrusive to the user than an *.ini. This can also be used 
to modify other parts of the registry. Feel free to use this in your project, if 
you do drop me a line at vb6@att.net. A mention in you greets would be 
nice to. You may use this in any progrem except punters, password 
stealers, or any other program designed to do harm. If you plan on selling 
your program for money get in touch with me FIRST. Thank you.
