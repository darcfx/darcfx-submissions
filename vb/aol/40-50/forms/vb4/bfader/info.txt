			No Scroll Bar Fader Example
				 by burden

This is just  another fader example. but i don't use scroll bars i use the common dialog ocx (included in 

VB) it can be made with any 32 bit Visual Basic. i used VB4, with Monk-e-Fade3.bas. this example just 

shows you how to fade the text normally and wavy. but if you got creative and wanted to use it to send 

faded IMs it would be easy. add another .bas with an IM send function, put in a new textbox (for the screen 

name), and in another button simply put Call sendIM (" + Text3.Text + ", " + Text2.Text + ")    if you have
