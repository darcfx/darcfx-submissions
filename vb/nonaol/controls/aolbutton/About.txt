Codes on how to use:
You don't need any really. All you have to do to make it work
is add it to your form and put code in the click event.

About:
This is a custom control button that looks just like some of the 
buttons aol uses. It even reacts the same when you click it or when 
it has the focus (modeled after the help button on the aol keyword 
window). It can even be resized (with both height and width) and
you can mess with the font face and font color.
