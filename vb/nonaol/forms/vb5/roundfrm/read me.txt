                              By: Þútõ²

This is a good example of a round form in VB5.
Just open it up, alot more BS in there
later all
vb6@att.net

NOTE: I can do alot of shapes but i am too lazy to do it, if you want a certain shape e-mail me requesting it. If you got this from anywhere other than KNK (www.knk2000.com) e-mail me and tell me where.
