This is my new class module. This basically is a aol4 
Massmailer or Server Object. You can add names to its built in collections or remove them. To send mail just call the method Forwardmail(index). So to send your whole mail box just do this

For X = 0 to test.mailCount - 1
	test.forwardmail (X)
next X

It will remove errored people (if ya want it to. Its all custom.)
It has a lot of features. Have fun
