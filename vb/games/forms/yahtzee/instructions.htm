<p>On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination for one of 13 categories.
  After you finish rolling, you must click the area you would like to place the score on the category.  
If you make a mistake in selecting the category you would like to place your score, you can hit ctrl-z or use the game 
menu to undo your last selection.  The game ends when you have filled all 13 categories.
  Scores are totalled, including any bonus points.</p>

<h3><font color="#008000">How To Play</font></h3>

<p>On each turn you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and score after your first or second roll.
  To roll the dice, just click the roll button.  On your first roll you will roll all five dice.  Click on any dice  
you would like to keep.  You may stop now if you'd like to score.  On your second roll you may re-roll any or all the
 dice you want even if you have previously kept them.  You may change your mind at anytime you want up to the end of 
 the turn on which dice to keep.  You may stop and score after your second time or click any dice you would like to 
 keep and roll again.  On your third and final roll, like the others you may select to keep any dice you want from your 
 previous rolls or roll them all again.  After this roll you MUST select a category to score in.  After you select the 
 category your turn is over. There is a total of 13 turns per game.</p>
