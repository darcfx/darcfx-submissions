Yo Yo everybody, this is RiP again.  Thanx for choosing 
to use my all new improved Chat Scanner version 2 for aol's
software version 4!  I gaurantee you that this chat 
control is one of the best one's out with more Functions 
than ever!!! This control beats any other Chat Scanner out 
there.  With this control, you will find Visual Basic 
programming easier to use and more fun!



The functions in this control are as following:

ScanOn - Turns the scanner on
ScanOff - Turns the scanner off

About - Tells you about the chat scanner
Advertise - Advertises the scanner
ChatSend - Sends a string to the Chat room
ClearChat - Clears the chat room
Example - Gives you an example of how to use the control 
LagChat - Sends a string to the chat room at lags (makes
          it look like the letters are being typed in
          the chat room.)
LinkSend - Sends a hyper link to the Chat room
SendEliteText - SÈNDs ÀLÕTÈ TÈXT

-------------------------- EXAMPLES ----------------------------

This Chat Control/Scanner is very simple to use.  To turn it on, 
type: Chat1.ScanOn in either Form_Load or in a command button.
From there you put your codeing in the Chat scanner.  It works 
like this; every time the the last chat line in the chat room 
appears, the chat scanner fires.  Who = the Screen name from the
last person to talk in the chat room, and What = what they said
(Last Chat Line).  It's that easy!!!

 
Example1:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase("Hi") Then
  Chat1.ChatSend "Hello " & Who & "!"
  End If
  End Sub

Example2:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase(".imoff") And Who = UserSN() Then
  Call InstantMessage("$IM_OFF", "Turn IMz off")
  End If
  End Sub

Example3:

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  Dim Person As String
  If Who = GetUser() And InStr(LCase(What), LCase(".x")) Then
  Person = Right(What, Len(What) - 2)
  Call ChatIgnoreByName(Person)
  Timeout 0.3
  Chat1.ChatSend "- --|[ " + Person + " - IGNORED!"
  Exit Sub
  End If
  End Sub

Example4(Server):

  Sub Chat1_ChatMsg(Who as String, What as String)
  If LCase(What) = LCase("/" & UserSN() & " Send List") Then
  List1.Additem "" & Who
  Chat1.ChatSend Who & ", request received!"
  End If
  End Sub
